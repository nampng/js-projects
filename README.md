# js-projects

This repository has some small projects that mostly involve Javascript.
Mainly for learning and exploring Javascript and frameworks.

I'm currently following a Udemy guide that shows me how to make some small projects using HTML, CSS, and JS.
After each lesson, I create my own spin-off of the tutorial project to reiterate some of the points.
